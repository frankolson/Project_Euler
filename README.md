=============

My solutions to the Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/

To keep fluent with my Python techniques I thought it might be a good idea to work out the solutions to
the problems posted on ProjectEuler.net. The site posts hundreds on programming math challenges that 
allow you to progress the next, and harder, problem after posting you solution. You are allowed to use
any programming language solution to solve these problems which I think is a fantastic way to help 
students learn and veterans keep their minds thoroughly lubricated.

Feel free to shoot me a message if you think my solutions could use some improvement and you have ideas
on how I can go about doing so.
